    Feature # 1: We want to enable users to see relevant search results despite minor typos.

    Feature # 2: Enable the user to view the top-rated movies worldwide, given that we have movie rankings available
     separately for different geographic regions.

    Feature # 3: As part of a demographic study, we are interested in the median age of our viewers. 
     We want to implement a functionality whereby the median age can be updated efficiently whenever a new user signs up for Netflix.

    Feature # 4: For efficiently distributing content to different geographic regions and for program recommendation to
     viewers, we want to determine titles that are gaining or losing popularity scores.
     
    Feature # 5: For the client application, we want to implement a cache with a replacement strategy that replaces
     the least recently watched title. 
     
    Feature # 6: As an alternative to the above, we want to implement a strategy of replacing the least frequently 
     watched titles in the cache.
